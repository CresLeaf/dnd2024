## Items
- The effects of certain equipment items will be adjusted to align with the above changes.  
- Items that exist in the data but do not appear in the game will now be available in Acts 1 to 3 through specific merchants, locations, or boss loot.

## Rules 

### Actions 
- Attack
    - Shove (Cost: 1 Action Point, Extra Attack)
    - Trip (Cost: 1 Action Point, Extra Attack)
- Break Free: Attempt to escape from conditions such as restraint or webs.
- Dodge
- Distraction
- Jump
    - Cost: 1 Bonus Action Point and 3m movement speed -> movement distance
- Spell Casting
    - You can only cast a spell of LvL 1 or higher once per turn.

### Condition
- Prone
    - Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, that attack roll has Disadvantage.
    - Do not break the concentraion.
- Vines
    - Plant-based surfaces are non-flammable.
- Web
    - Webs are non-flammable.
- Wet
    - The status is removed when taking cold, fire, or lightning damage.

> The reason for making vines and webs less flammable is to balance both realism and strategic enjoyment in the game. Realistically, fresh vines or webs do not instantly burn entirely just because a single spark lands on them. For example, when a flame touches a spider web, only the affected area burns away while the rest remains intact. Reflecting this, summoned vines and webs have been adjusted to prevent complete destruction by fire.
> This change not only enhances realism but also aims to increase the utility of lesser-used spells like Entangle and Web. Previously, these spells were situational and underutilized, primarily because of their vulnerability to fire. By making them more resistant to burning, players can now take full advantage of their potential in a variety of tactical scenarios.
> Ultimately, this adjustment enhances immersion while providing players with more strategic options and opportunities to incorporate these spells effectively into their gameplay.

### Initiative
